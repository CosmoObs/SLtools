Arcfitting is a code developed to fit arcs parameters using ArcEllipse analytical expression 
and Sersic profile.

It uses the analytical expression of ArcEllipse combined with a Sersic profile to fit the
arc parameters from an arc image. The ArcEllipse expression is the result of a deformation of an 
ellipse such that one of its main axes becomes a circle segment. The Sersic profile is used to 
describe the radial light distribution of the arc. 

It uses chi2 minimization to find the best fit parameters values. The chi2 minimization is done 
using Pyminuit.

To run Arcfitting it is necessary to have the arc images in the same directory and to create an 
input file, called "input_images.txt", where the arc images names are placed one for each line. 


Finally, to run the code, just type:
> python arcfitting.py
