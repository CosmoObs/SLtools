External dependencies to install sltools
============================================

Before installing sltools you need to instal:

- Python 2.5 or 2.6 (sltools was not tested with Python 3.0)
- Other Python packages: numpy and matplotlib
- Python development files (python-dev)
- gcc, GNU Compiler Collection 
- g++
- swig

To install these dependencies you can install the packages from 
your Linux/Mac distribution.

External applications required:

- gravlens 1.99o (binary)
- sextractor 2.5.0 (source code)
- WCSTools 3.7.7 (source code)
- pyfits 1.0.7 (python source)
- pywcs 1.9-4.4.4 (python source)

All command line tools must be available in the system path, edit your .bashrc or .cshrc if needed to include the correspondent paths to the PATH environment variable.

Installation procedure:

- Gravlens: a software for gravitational lensing developed by Chuck Keeton - is distributed as binary only.

- Sextractor:  after extracted from tarball follow the package installation instructions.

- WCSTools : from wcstools we just need sky2xy and xy2sky. So, if you don't want to compile the whole package, just type:

> make sky2xy 
> make xy2sky

and a directory "bin" will be created with the tools you just build. 

- Pyfits : to install pyfits just follow the instructions inside the package. Pyfits needs NumPy to run. Basically you will have to type:

$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install

Tip: For installing python modules, try to use "easy_install", distributed within "setuptools":
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

- Pywcs: is a set of routines for handling the FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) standard

http://stsdas.stsci.edu/astrolib/pywcs-1.9-4.4.4.tar.gz

====================================================================

After all is set up, just type:

$ ./install.sh

You will be prompted to especify a instalation directory and then to add some lines to your login file (.login, .bashrc or equivalent).

Now you can import sltools in the Pyton console:

$ import sltools

you are done!


Enjoy.
