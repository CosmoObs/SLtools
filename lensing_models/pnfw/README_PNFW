Codes for computing relevant quantities for the PNFW model
This model uses the Angle Deflection Convention 
(see Habib DÃºmet-Montoya, Gabriel Caminha & Martin Makler (2010), in preparation...)

Parameter definition:

ks = characteristic convergence
rs= scale radius
elp= ellipticity parameter
lw_u= local approximation for the length-to-width ratio (must be greather than 1)
mu_th = threshold magnification

Quantities of interest
sigma_q: arc cross section as a function of lens paramenter (ks, elp) and (lw_u)
sigma_0: arc cross section computed for elp=0
sigma_u: arc cross section computed for mu>mu_th
mu_min= minimum magnification


Control Parameters
iflag= flag to compute the desired option
npts= number of points to compute curves.


---+++ To compile the code, uses some fortran 77 compiler (for77_compiler= g77-3.4, gfortran-3.4 or gfortran-4.4)---+++

--+ To plot PNFW model curves, use the pnfw_contours.f

$for77_compiler -o exec_name pnfw_contours.f lensing_functions.f root_finding.f

./exec_name (To run the program)

   * Mandatory have the input file "in_pnfw_par.txt" : ks rs elp lw_u iflag npt 

   * If iflag=1, the code only plots the tangential and radial curves (both critical and caustic curves)

      Output files: 

      For the tangential curves : fort.65 (critical curves), fort.75 (caustics)
      Also the plot for critical lines in each quadrant, from 1st to 4th, fort.61, fort.62, fort.63, fort.64
      the plot for caustics lines in each quadrant, from 1st to 4th, fort.71, fort.72, fort.73, fort.74

      For the radial curves : fort.25 (critical curves), fort.35 (caustics)
      Also the plot for critical lines in each quadrant, from 1st to 4th, fort.21, fort.22, fort.23, fort.24
      the plot for caustics lines in each quadrant, from 1st to 4th, fort.31, fort.32, fort.33, fort.34

   * If iflag=2, the code plot the region of tangential arc formation with length-to-width ratio>= lw.
    
      Together with the plot for tangential curves, the output files are too

      ** Length-to-width curves < -|lw_u|: fort.45 (lens plane), fort.65 (source plane).    

      Also the plot in each quadrant of the lens plane: fort.41 ... fort.44
      Also the plot in each quadrant of the source plane: fort.61 ... fort.64


      ** Length-to-width curves > |lw_u|: fort.85 (lens plane), fort.95 (source plane).
      Also the plot in each quadrant of the lens plane: fort.81 ... fort.84
      Also the plot in each quadrant of the source plane: fort.91 ... fort.94




--++ For compute the arc cross section for deformation arcs "sigma_q", use arc_cross_section.f 

$for77_compiler -o exec_name arc_cross_section.f arc_cross_subroutine.f  lensing_functions.f root_finding.f

./exec_name (To run the program)

    *Mandatory two input file files "ifile" and "ifile2":

    *ifile: iflag ks elp lw_u muth
    where iflag is the flag to compute the arc cross section as a function of some quantity.

    *ifile2: qu_min qu_max N_qu
    where qu_min, qu_max correspond to lower limit and upper limit for a quantity to be varied. N_qu is the number of point uses to divide 
    the range [qu_min, qu_max]. This file depend of the choice for iflag.

    *Output file (for any choice of iflag) is fort.3

    *If iflag=1: mu_th is varies
      output file: muth sigma_u/sigma_q

    *If iflag=2 : ks is varies
      output file : ks sigma_q u_min

    *If iflag=3 : elp is varies
      output file: e sigma_q u_min (if you are interested in to have sigma_q/sigma_0, comment line 108 and uncoment line 107)

    *If iflag=4 : lw_u is varies
      output file: lw_u sigma_q u_min
