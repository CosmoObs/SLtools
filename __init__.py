Strong Lensing Tools

This library is developed with the main goal of supporting astronomical 
daily computations. General functions for astronomical data/applications 
handling, and particularly, for strong lensing calculations can be found 
here; from sky coordinate units convertion till gravitational arcs simulation
methods can be found on the modules collection below. Enjoy.


The following example shows how to import a package:

    import sltools.image

Use the help command to see the available modules or details for this package.

    help(sltools.image)

    help(sltools.image.add_images)

The following command makes the modules available in the current namespace:
